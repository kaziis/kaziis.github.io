<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>My name is Kazi Shahria. I am an undergraduate student at Baruch College.
    I have become interested in learning and trying many things throughout my years.
    I used to edit videos, produce beats, create websites, run businesses, etc.
    I have interned in industries such as finance and marketing and now working as a freelancer.
    Over the years, my interests changed to dealing more with data and numbers.
    With so much information collected every second, I wonder how much is known and unknown and what can and can't be done.
    I love asking questions and finding answers to those questions.
    Learning about the Data Science path was the right career, I like experimenting, writing code, and playing detective.
    Uncovering secrets and finding why gives a lot of leverage for a business.
    My past had a purpose to what I am doing now, and I am very proud I was able to test many things, now,
    I am improving my background in programming, data science, and math because
    I want to pursue this career and find the beauty in data.</p>
