## Project Portfolio

### CNN Neural Network
[Convolutional Neural Network](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wuB79hI9Xfpf9VEfa8C7XK1zfqPr2q5O)

Build a deep learning model using [The Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) and use frameworks such as Tensorflow and Scikit-learn to develop a model with ~97% accuracy.

### Movie Recommender System
[Netflix Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/kaziis/movie-recommender-system/blob/main/notebook/V1_MRS.ipynb)

Replicated the Netflix recommender system by using the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) and utilized libraries in __Python__, for example, NLTK and Scikit-learn. As a group, we were given the freedom to set thresholds and improve results based on popularity ratings and data analysis on certain columns.
